# High Availability & Scalability with AWS

This repository seeks to explain the ways of ensuring high availability and scalability for cloud instances; 

- Using disaster recovery with S3 buckets to ensure delivery and availability of data, including logs.

- Using Cloudwatch for monitoring and alert systems to ensure robust delivery of instances, with mechanisms for notifications, such as SNS and SQS. To ensure the 

- Using auto scaling groups for instances which are managed on a load banlancer, to provide scalability in the form of min/desired/max sizes for instance groups, as well as availability which are placed and managed by the load balancer on different availability zones.
